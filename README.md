# DWMA-Simple-Data-Mart-Implementation-
Aim: The team has proposed to build a data mart that can help in making sophisticated decisions about the quality of VLE materials, which material type benefit students the most, and how to give the most resourceful VLE materials for students.

Objectives:
•	To recognize the stakeholders and find out how our data mart can support their decision-making related to our aim.
•	To choose the data set to carry out the analysis to achieve our aim.
•	To list out the reports which will help us in our analysis to fulfill our requirements of building the specific data mart.
•	To identify and discuss different architectures and methodologies of data mart and to choose the most suitable one for our data mart implementation.
•	To design the star schema for the decision support system based on our reports.

This data mart will support the decision-making process of the university’s deputy VC and team for the Key Performance Indicator (KPI), which is delivering the most resourceful VLE materials for students to improve their performance in studies and to help with their learning behaviors. The following reports are needed in helping the decision-making related to this specific KPI.
1.	Most used VLE material type in each year
2.	The least used VLE material type in each year
3.	Number of days spend per VLE material type per year
4.	Number of days spend on ‘url’ VLE material type in 2020 
5.	Number of days spend on ‘resource’ VLE material type in 2021
6.	Which year has the most involvement in the VLE materials
7.	Percentage increase per VLE material per year
8.	Number of sum clicks per VLE material type per year
9.	Number of students who are disabled and used any  type of VLE materials per year
10.	Number of students who unregistered and used any type of VLE material per year
